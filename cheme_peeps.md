### sub-specializations

### sectors

#### Manufacturing Sector

Although manufacturing sector jobs are of diverse nature, but at the starting of the career Engineers are generally appointed as Field Engineers, Shift Engineers and Supervisors. The job of an on-field engineer is to ensure that the process runs smoothly and safely. Oil and gas sector pays a lot of importance to work safety because of the dangerous nature of the products that are processed. Engineers also work as technical advisers where trouble shooting of process is the main job.

#### Process Design and Technology Development

These are white collar jobs. Companies like UOP, fluor Daniels, Bechtel are some of the best process design companies or in technical terms Detailed Engineering constructors. They are responsible for designing of a new plant compromising of all the aspects of piping, instrumentation and material design. These jobs are mostly require very good analytical and simulation skills.

#### Research and Development

The R&D of some companies hire Chemical Engineers for this profile. Companies like Unilever hire graduates, while rest of the companies prefer post graduates and doctors. This is a very specialized job. The work is directed towards developing or new product or a efficient process of manufacturing. They mainly work in labs and the work culture is like any other research field.

### sub-fields

There are various sub-fields such as Environment Engineers, Sustainability Engineers, People working in R&D Departments, going for Administrative jobs, IT and App Designing. Also the 'Chemical Engineers' who work in Industries are called Process Engineers.

Chemical engineers work in manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, healthcare, design and construction, pulp and paper, petrochemicals, food processing, speciality chemicals, microelectronics, electronic and advanced materials, polymers, business services, biotechnology, and environmental health and safety industries, environment protection, sustainable development, among others.

Core job roles include plant operator, process designer, R&D, analyst, process modulation (like a software engineer), field analyst, many are into administration and many more.

## advice
### 1

So a little about my career. I started off as an intern in R&D. Loved it. Couldn’t imagine doing anything but that. Ended up getting a job running pilot plants. Got switched into an operations role. Loved it... I thought. I actually enjoyed the work, but it was because I enjoyed the people I worked with. Hated the company. Probably didn’t want to do operations there for 20 years, but never realized it. They laid me off. I found another job in an entirely different industry doing a process design type role. Had to move for family and went into project engineering.

I’ve had lots of jobs in this industry with lots of different people and I’ve hated some moments and loved others.

If you’re having a hard time in your role, just remember that you are not tied to that role and not tied to that company. You can learn more and you can grow more in a role that challenges you.

Your typical day doesn’t sound like what I would classify as the type of engineering I would enjoy so it makes sense you don’t enjoy it.

You’re not Superman, you can’t do anything, but being a Chem E means you can do a lot of things.

### 2

the important part is that in this industry, you write your career. You decide what you want to do. There are some doors that close because of your decisions, but most doors are pretty open.

### 3

I started my first job in process controls for PLCs and dcs.

I do software automation now with a chemical engineering degree. I got into process automation/controls and kept going deeper into the software side. It's not and uncommon role for chemical engineers due to their process experience.

### 4

Start probing the edges. System integration, sales, process control, material science, data analytics, sensors, catalysts. Read some biographies of different type of Chem Engs. The guy who did the rail gun, northern lights and NOx chemistry is a good one.

You do have a lot invested here, invest some more to learn how to make it right for you. I personally haven't done process chemistry since shortly after graduating.

### 5

Bro/sis, if you want to get a very good understanding of what it takes to be a good process engineer, look up books by a guy named Norm Lieberman. Any forewards in his books give you real-life peeks into raw chemical engineering and troubleshooting.

### 6

If you want to earn more money, go to industry. But if you want personal freedom, get a PhD. You get to be your own boss, publish some high quality papers and possibly patents.

## people talking about the kinds of work they're doing but whom aren't clearly expressing whether they like it

### 1

I did validation work for two years. Never saw a chemical process, never interacted with any real equipment. Basically did maintenance and utilities work. I just recently started a job at a chemical plant as a chemical engineer.

### 2

I'm currently working as a research and development engineer in a company that specializes in ion exchange.. So I do some pilot testing, mass balances on the system etc (10 months into the job). I also worked as a proposal engineer for 8 months (compiling proposals for project bidding).

### 3

I worked for 5 years in industry and largely disliked it so now I’m going to grad school for my PhD in Chemical Engineering. The field is vastly interesting at this level in comparison to cut & dry chemical processing. So research some research and see if anything catches your eye then go after that!

### 4

I am currently a postgraduate student specializing in PSE ( Process Systems Engineering) conducting research work for publication in preferred journals. It entails but not limited to plant design, optimization and control. PSE and Chemical engineering in general requires the use of a number of software tools including Aspen plus, HYSIS, gPROMS, Matlab and CFD (computational fluid dynamics) tools (such as FLUENT, Comsol multiphysics, OpenFoam etc) as well as some advanced mathematical concepts in both calculus and numerical analysis coupled with a good understanding of the underlying process chemistry.

### 5

A close friend of mine got his bachelors in Chem Eng from MIT.
He then attended another college (Michigan ?) and got his PhD.
He started working for a large company.
However, as a student he also learned to fly.
After one year with the company, he decided he had enough with Chemical Engineering and quit.
He joined Flying Tigers as a flight engineer hauling cargo.
He rose through the ranks, Flying Tiger got bought by FedEx and he is now a Senior Captain for FedEx flying cargo aircraft all over the world.
And he can spot a dangerous chemical shipment a mile away.......

### 6

Its like wearing a hard hat , hard shoes and entering a sounding manufacturing plant supervising and inspecting various sections of plant , product quality and meeting operator s to know and solve problems. To be there in the critical situations , emergencies , load increase and decrease , start up and shutdowns helping operations to take right decisions and stand by it !

### 7

Currently at in internship within a water treatment company, I can say that the majority of my work involves ensuring that the plant that the firm is constructing will be able to produce potable water with the standards defined in the commercial agreement. In short, quality assurance of the main chemical process within the plant.

Other jobs that Process Engineers do usually involve designing processes to optimize the yield of certain useful commercial chemical reactions, such as the Haber process for yielding ammonia, the fermentation of sugars to produce alcohols etcetera

Process Engineers are also unique in their understanding of Process Safety, in which they plan, design and recommend relevant safeguards for the processes within the manufacturing plant. As such, you will find many of them in the safety line, either as safety supervisors or managers.

The working hours of a Process Engineer are usually the same as the daily operation hours of the plant, which is from 9-5pm. In general, Process Engineers are not required to work shift hours unless otherwise stated.

From what I have observed, most of the Process Engineers who are working in the industry have retained the passion that drove them through one of the most challenging courses in university. A job as a Process Engineer is usually very demanding in terms of visualizing and imaging process flows, constraints and possible safety incidents that might occur. However, it is rewarding to see the final product being created in the end, and knowing that you had a major part to play in the creation process. 

### 8

While studying there is less practical experience and less industrial exposure that is main dissatisfaction for me. The study and the field of working is completely different and there is a lot to learn in real than the things that we study.

## people talking about their work who seem to like what they're doing

### 1

Are you good at project management, or people management? I did the traditional process engineering job for a couple of years and then became a plant supervisor at a pharma company. I even tried process controls engineering for about a year. Now, six years out of college, I'm in a mid-senior plant management role at a different company.

I've learned supply chain, finance, EHS, QC, Lean Manufacturing, etc. Interactions with customers, Capital projects are things that get me going nowadays.

I agree, I got bored trying to streamline a unit operation when I was a process engineer. But from that, are there other roles you can check out?

(when asked about being a process engineer) It was okay. Mostly writing ladder logic, implementation of corrective actions on PLC errors, and learning about I/O. It's great, but being in plant management paid more, so I left it.

### 2

That's the route I'm taking, training to be an operations manager after graduating last May. Much more interesting than traditional ChemE jobs, no two days are the same and always something new. A lot more responsibility and a lot more autonomy

### 3

/u/Weltal327: Project, Process, Operations / 9 years

I think that fundamentals with material balances were the first thing that I liked in chemical engineering. And still like 12 years later.

### 4 (a mixed but interesting perspective)

I graduated having not really enjoyed any of my classes. Sure, McCabe-Thiele diagrams were kinda fun. To be honest, though, I've directly applied so little of what I learned. I've done mass balances, sized pumps, used psychrometric charts, pressure drop calculations. A lot of basic engineering stuff.

You're going to get more enjoyment out of the industry you work in than your classes. I've been in industry now for about 8 years. It gets better once you get to apply your knowledge to real world problems. As long as you enjoy engineering at its core you will do fine.

### 5

The thing I like about chem e is I can do a whole range of things if I decide I don't like what I'm doing now. For example, a good friend of mine works at a coffee roaster making sure each batch is consistent with the last batch, another friend designs semi-conductors for a computer company, and I design medical devices that treat breast cancer. There are SO MANY paths ahead that it's hard to say chem e isnt right for you right out of the gate. It could just be a bad company that's souring your perspective.

### 6

Chemical Engineering in college sucks. I didn't really like any of my classes until junior/senior year, and my professors had never worked in a chemical plant before. I fell in love with ChE after getting my co-op, working in a chemical plant, and seeing that it is completely different than school! ChE school teaches you some core principles, but mainly it teaches you a logical way of thinking and problem solving. Being able to troubleshoot problems and brainstorm solutions is awesome, and I love being a ChE because of the feelings I get from solving these big problems!

### 7

I like how as an individual I am able to make a big impact whether that be in dollars, environmental impact or through engineering that has the potential to save someone’s life.

### 8

If it doesn't work out i can always cook meth( on an industrial scale O_O )

### 9

We as electrical engineers want to understand what the flow of electrons, the resultant potential difference etc. physically is. On the other hand, we sometimes like to think of it as a black box, concentrating on how we can put the underlying principles into use and change the real world.

For me this is exactly is! I perhaps am not the most theoretical guy out there, I don't have to fully understand every elementary step of a reaction scheme to the extent a chemist would probably do. Understanding it to the extent with which you are then able to design an entire process transforming materials into valuable commodities is absolutely beautiful. A few examples here:

How can e.g. CaO and CaCO3 based chemical looping cycles capture CO2 and potentially be a short term mitigation option to combat climate change?

How are microorganisms utilised to transform corn into fuel grade bio-ethanol?

Chemical engineers take care of all these intermediate process blocks, starting from the reactors and various separation units all the way down to the piping and safety relief systems. This intrigues me deeply. Hope I could spark some interest in you.

### 10

ChemE provided the most diverse scientific education of any engineering discipline. In addition, its also a field that exposes everyone to systems level thinking. You learn applied maths, physics, chemistry and biology (which are all fascinating, even if your biology classes at school were shit), as well as economics and all the transferable skills that make you extremely employable.

### 11

Working in consulting has a huge variety of projects with constant change and new challenges all the time paired with constant learning regardless of experience level!

### 12

You can literally go in any field. Due to the workload and a vast understanding this major requires, you have proved to a potential employer that with a little training you can be an asset. I am an account manager and was picked over SBI fukboiiz

### 13

/u/APC_ChemE: Advanced Process Control Engineer / 7 years

I work in advanced process control. Essentially I design and implement multivariable controllers that can be thought of as autopilots at process plants like oil refineries and chemical plants. They help the operators control the process by watching and respecting key process constraints each minute and driving the process to operate as efficently as possible. I love the work because you get to learn all about different processes then you implement a controller. It's very satisfying when the controller you implemented is smoothly driving the process to run with the lowest operating cost, maximum profit, and the operators accept it as their autopilot.

I didn't want to be a process engineer working on the same units day in day out. I wanted to work on lots of different units and travel for work. I enjoyed my process control course and advanced process control course in school so my senior year I applied to be an APC engineer consultant. I don't work at a plant, I work for an APC consulting firm and design and implement APC controllers for customers at their plants.

### 14

Chemical Engineering degrees typically don't lead to dull job prospects. My job is challenging (but I am NOT a great engineer, and it a process type job), but I enjoy the location and hours and some coworkers.

### 15

Out of engineering subjects it’s one of the roles that gives more room for development of leadership qualities, that’s one thing to consider as well. In a typical plant or engineering design firm, process engineers kinda lead other disciplines in decision making situations.

### 16 Ray Jones, graduated 1970

It is a very challenging and rewarding profession. I especially liked process design phase of any project. Where you develop the flow diagrams, turn them into the Process and Instrumentation Diagrams, that lead to the specifications for each valve, control valve, pump, heat exchanger, pressure vessel, reactor etc, etc, etc, …. that eventually becomes the new chemical process and ultimately the chemical processing plant that produces the desired chemical(s) …..

It is especially fun with the new computerized process control systems, to make them work and coordinate with the equipment to efficiently, and safely produce the required capacity of chemical(s)….. that the plant is designed to produce.

Plant start ups can be fun and quite challenging, with long hours, until the plant gets up to speed and demonstrates reliably that it can produce the required capacity and quality of chemical product it was designed to make .

Or alternately, to identify the changes and “fixes” needed to make it come up to production and quality spec and them implement them successfully.

### 17 (note: this guy does long hours)

I uses to work as a Chemical engineer for 3.5 years after university. I worked in the field of factory automation at Emerson Process and worked in various countries in Oil and Gas, Petrochemicals, Pharma.

I designed automation for factories, worked in offices on proprietary systems and also went to factory sites for commissioning and startup of the factory units.

I loved every moment of it. Working hours in an office are 8 - 10 hours and working in site could be 15 - 16 hours, because there is only a small number of days to get the job done.

If you become a chemical engineer, you're going to have a great time. All the best. 

### 18

When I became a senior undergrad ChE student, I realized that chemical engineering is more deep, versatile and beautiful than I thought. After graduating bachelor's degree in ChE, I noticed that chemical engineers actively get involved in every engineering field. I got chances to meet a bunch of smart chemical engineers at work. It was a great motivation for me.

I'm totally satisfied with my profession. There's no reason to rethink or regret on my choice of engineering major. Chemical engineering is indeed a very versatile engineering branch on this planet. 

Have you noticed that thermal engineering becomes a very demanding engineering professional in industries? Look back on what we learned during academic years. Heat transfer, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and others associated with energy and mass transfer. My goodness! It's a great chance for chemical engineers who get sucked into those bio/pharmaceutical things and organic/inorganic like chemist's stuffs. Personally, I left those boring traits since I attained my bachelor's in chemical engineering. When I did my master's in chemical engineering, fortunately, I specialized in the field of thermal sciences which led me the whole new experience in life.

So for chemical engineers who have a bad feeling on those biochemical/pharmaceutical stuffs, just leave 'em behind. If you feel these traits are just nothing but wasting your time, then get started to feel the essence of thermal engineering. Heat and fluids, you know. Very fundamental things in daily life. You have to work with 'em. You have to apply 'em. That's miracle.

As I told you, chemical engineering is versatile enough to choose our own paths.

### 19

#### Are chemical engineers happy with their choice of degree?

Yes! Yes we are! I say on behalf of my ChemE study group of about eight. That was 16 years ago.

#### What were you most and least pleased about while studying?

* most please with each successful quarter meaning the sense of accomplishment after a mental marathon considering it was considered one of the most challenging subjects.
* I was least pleased with not having time to enjoy leisure college life, which why I just stayed an extra two quarter after my completion of core classes. However, the bond between your study groups, who only they know what you are experiencing, is on the top of my best experiences.

#### How are you using the degree, now that you have graduated?

There is excitement when you get more than you imagined. I was surprised some of the roles people lead when I learn they have a ChemE degree.

In my group of ChemE’s I feel each is now following their personal journey and personality. Titles are: refinery, nuclear, electrical, projects, technical sales, startup company of medical, biotech, full time mothers/fathers, on a personal sabbatical, technical manager in food company, went to law school, technician for computers, computer scientist, etc.

Industries have ups/downs but an engineer is never obsolete because the fundamental remain. Example: An film engineer that worked for Fuji back when we developed photos now has multiple patents because he took that and applied it to printhead technologies. Now think 3-D printer patents.

I was tempted to get philosophical about happiness. I can tell you that I had an office that oversaw the pacific ocean, making money, a home and living along the coast but I was not happy because my happiness was being around parents, siblings, travelling, open range, agricultural land and places I knew.

## work life balance

### 1

Currently I am sitting in an Air Conditioned office in NCR in front of my PC. My working hours are 8.30 to 5 . I can understand why you asked this question because most of the people assume a chemical engineer's job to be in one of the factories loaded fill dust, full of heat in a secluded area from city. But it is not the only kind of job chemical engineer gets. There are some other fields also in which chemical engineers can go which are core jobs as well. An EPC is one of the best suited jobs. In an EPC company we take construction projects from refineries and chemical engineers make their design and drawings sitting in office located in metro cities.

## impact

### 1

Chemical Engineering has tremendous opportunities to grow, both in fields of industrial and academic research. Due to its uniqueness of mass transfer and reaction engineering principles, it plays an important role in the quality control of the chemicals produced on large scale. The trend is shifting more towards the molecular interpretations so as to improve upon the existing processes and find solutions to some of the greatest engineering challenges such as waste management and environmental protection.

## detailed personal stories

### 1 (happy!)

 My degree is actually in chemical and biomedical engineering, but I graduated right at the start of the 2008-09 recession. I took what I could get, but after changing jobs/companies I'm really happy with how things turned out. Plus I just happened to pick an engineering discipline that pays well.

I'm a process design engineer, so my day varies, depending on if I'm in my office or out in a chemical plant. In the office my job is a lot of math. I size equipment, calculate heat output from reactions, determine operating temperatures and pressures, and a lot of other work to make sure my chemicals come out right. I also write the operating procedures for new equipment, since at the time of installation I'm the only one who knows how its supposed to work. I work with chemists who study the detailed properties of my chemicals and reactions. I work with other engineers to present my work, have it reviewed, and integrate it with their projects into an overall chemical plant. I work with business personnel to make sure that my plant will make the right amount and right quality chemicals for them to sell. I'll work with health, safety, & environmental personnel to make sure that my designs are safe and won't pollute the environment.

In the field (chemical plants) my job is inspection and guidance, or at least it should be. I'll look at existing equipment I need to modify. I'll check new equipment to make sure it has been installed properly. I'll work with mechanics and electricians to fix problems. I'll work with operators to teach them how the plant should run. The operators will also report problems to me that need to get fixed, and they'll help me make sure new equipment is user friendly. This last one is something a lot of people miss, but no matter how good your equipment is on paper, if no one can figure out how to operate it it won't make a single pound of product. I'll also work with the rest of the adminstrative staff to make sure they can support the plant properly. And every so often I get to go hands on myself and run something I created. That part kind of feels like playing with Legos or Kinex, except I might spend anywhere form $2,000 to $200 million on what I built. (My personal max budget has been about $30 million, but I didn't get to stay on the project to the point it was built)

### 2

Well, I can't claim to know what life and work are like for every chemical engineer in industry, but I can give some general examples from my own experiences in the production and process engineering areas. It might be substantially different for sales and customer representative engineers, or for consulting engineers.

A chemical engineer's job usually has a lot of variety. Some days you're fixing malfunctioning equipment with wrenches alongside overworked mechanics, and others you're in your office putting together financials and design for an efficiency or production project. Still others you are cajoling operators to run the process in a safer or more efficient way, not the way they've always done it. The fact the hours aren't always regular comes with the territory. An industrial chemical engineer can't expect to get there at 7:00 AM and leave at 3:30 every single day. So if you don't want to do the exact same thing every day, a chemical engineering job might appeal to you.

As for the workplace, that can vary a lot depending on where you work and with whom. What I can say is that it is unlikely you'll be in a formal environment. As long as you wear the correct protective equipment for your work area, there is little dress code. Expect to communicate with down-to-earth people a lot, not pretentious suit-and-tie types.

A chemical engineer can expect his life to be comfortable. With the good pay of engineering jobs, you won't be pressed for cash as long as you manage your money wisely. You'll be able to afford a decent housing and transportation with no problem. Depending on your job, you may not get to do as many social activities and events as you'd like because of the hours, but many engineers (because of their demographic predilections) aren't really into that scene anyway.

### 3

You will generally work a typical 8-9 hour day with a decent amount of desk work, mixed with some basic field work at a plant. Process engineers will do more field work than someone in design but most every chemical engineer I know has some of both in their average day.

You will work a lot with other people from a lot of varied backgrounds (operators who never graduated college but can tell you exactly what every valve and pipe and equipment does in the plant to PhD level researchers who have 20-30+ years experience in a single chemical reaction). Obviously you will have to deal with these people differently and sometimes they might be on the same team together.

You will deal a lot with number and calculations and formulas and equipment, but none of this stuff is stuff you should memorize. Understanding the basics and the meaning of the numbers is what is important as you will be the person that is asked the question of what to do in the event of X.

TL:DR. Its more understanding the topics than the formulas and dealing with people from all walks of life to both understand and manage a process and keep everything running smoothly.

## personal experiences with focus on travel

### 1

I have worked as a process design engineer for most of my career in various design consulting companies. So, I used to travel but I would say monthly, but yes may be once annually. The requirement used to be either for some project related deputation or some technical meetings with the client or vendors. The frequency of travel would also depend upon in which company you are working for, like if your company has main headquarters in some other country and you are working at some branch office in some other country then there is quite a possibility that you have to travel frequently for the technical meetings.

For e.g. I was working in Petrofac engineering in India and our head office was at Sharjah, so I traveled to Sharjah may be twice in a year.

Few of my friends are working in the manufacturing plant as production engineer and they hardly travel (until and unless they have to travel by themselves for tourism, I guess). They are recruited as production engineer for that particular manufacturing plant and their main job is to ensure that the plant is running fine and the production is not affected.

###

When I first started working out of school I think it was almost two years before I took a work trip. It was from San Fransisco to Charlotte, Monday to Friday. I didn't travel again for months. In the last five years I've maybe been on two dozen work trips. This wasn't really by design, just kind of the way my job has progressed.

My wife is also a chemical engineer. Her career started at a company with much more travel expectancy. 6 days at a time, about once a month for three years. Her current role has her travelling closer to 0%, one trip in about two years. Again, this was not really by design, just the way it happened. Not a bad thing though.

One of my friends worked in a rotational program for an oil consulting company when he was an entry level engineer. This was nearly 100% travel. So, my buddy didn't even have to hold an apartment in the US. Since he didn't live here, he didn't have to pay US taxes. I think his program was 4 years, now his current role can go between 1–2 weeks a month on the road. Last time I talked to him he was planning on working with his bosses to decrease it a bit more. He just got married, and I suspect that was part of the reason for the switch.

My point here is that you can travel a lot, or a little, and it has very little to do specifically with being a chemical engineer.

If you want to travel, look for companies that have locations spread all over the place, that serve clients and customers all over the place.

I knew a guy who didn't really like to travel, but would always volunteer for HAZOP projects so he could get a company sponsored flight and then add a few vacation days for a ski trip (very much location and season dependant).
